# 📊 Project 08 – Excel WFM Real-Time Performance Monitoring

This project simulates real-world Workforce Management (WFM) performance tracking using **Microsoft Excel**. It analyzes team adherence, agent productivity, and hourly call volumes to determine if **service level agreements (SLAs)** are being met.

---

### 🧠 Business Problem

WFM analysts must track in real-time:
- How many calls are planned vs. actually handled?
- Which agents are on time, late, or offline?
- What hours are the busiest?
- Are we meeting our SLA for adherence?

---

### 🛠️ Tools Used
- Microsoft Excel (Pivot Tables, Charts, Formulas)
- Conditional Formatting
- KPI Summary Tables
