# Patient Visits Data Cleaning (SQL)

*From raw rows to insight — a clear arc from question to answer.*

## Problem
Improve healthcare data quality at scale within SQL Server.

## Data
Large visits table with timestamps, patient IDs, clinician IDs, visit types.

## Approach
Detected missing values, duplicates, and outliers; generated summary statistics and audit tables.

## Key Insights
- Null and duplicate reduction reported
- Outlier thresholds documented
- Clean table ready for downstream analytics

## Tools
SQL Server (Profiling, Window Functions where applicable)

## Skills Demonstrated
Data governance, profiling, reproducible cleaning

## Repository Contents
- `data/` — sample or anonymised dataset(s)
- `workbooks/` / `sql/` / `notebooks/` — core project files
- `outputs/screenshots/` — static visuals for quick preview

Add a `profiling.sql` and `cleaning.sql`, plus a `README` charting before/after metrics.
