# Company Sales Dashboard (Excel)

*From raw rows to insight — a clear arc from question to answer.*

## Problem
Create an interactive dashboard for stakeholders to track performance at a glance.

## Data

## Approach
Calculated Final Sales Amount after discounts, segmented “High/Normal” sales, and designed a slicer-driven dashboard.

## Key Insights
- Top-performing products highlighted
- Underperforming regions flagged
- Seasonal peaks visualised via line charts

## Tools
Excel (Pivot Tables/Charts, Slicers)

## Skills Demonstrated
Dashboard storytelling, segmentation, KPI cards

## Repository Contents
- `data/` — sample or anonymised dataset(s)
- `workbooks/` / `sql/` / `notebooks/` — core project files
- `outputs/screenshots/` — static visuals for quick preview

Include a GIF or PNGs of the dashboard to improve quick scanning.
