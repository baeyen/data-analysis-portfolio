Results (Laptop revenue by region)

| Region    |  May Revenue | June Revenue |     % Change |
| --------- | -----------: | -----------: | -----------: |
| **South** | \$27,910,000 | \$15,640,000 |  **−43.96%** |
| **East**  | \$34,660,000 |  \$9,890,000 |  **−71.47%** |

#What stands out

-East suffered the steepest fall (−71%; ≈ $24.7M loss).

-West grew strongly (+157%), suggesting demand or supply dynamics differ by region.

#South and North also declined, but less severely.

#Likely root-cause angles (to validate)

-Inventory / Supply: stockouts, late replenishment, delivery delays.

-Pricing / Promotions: discount cadence changes, competitor undercutting, bundle shifts.

-Marketing: reduced spend, targeting changes, or paused campaigns in East.

-Quality / CX: product issues driving returns or negative word-of-mouth.

#What we need from teams

-Marketing: campaign spend, creatives, and targeting for May–June (laptops).

-Supply Chain: on-hand, backorders, lead times by region.

-Pricing/Product: price/bundle changes vs competitors.

-Customer Service: complaint/return volume and themes for June.
