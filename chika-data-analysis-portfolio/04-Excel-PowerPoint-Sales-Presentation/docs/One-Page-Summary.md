*A crisp view of what dipped, where, and what we’ll do next.*

## SMART problem statement
Laptop sales in the **East** region dropped **71%** from May to June 2025, causing an estimated **$24.7M** revenue loss. We will identify likely causes via data analysis and stakeholder inputs, and deliver fixes and an action plan **within 5 working days**.

## Data & method (Excel)
- Source: `workbooks/E-commerce Sales Data project 1.xlsx`
- Computed **Month** from Date, aggregated Laptop revenue by Region and Month with `SUMIFS`.
- Compared **May vs June**, calculated **% change**, and visualized with a clustered column chart.

## Results — Laptop revenue by region
| Region | May Revenue | June Revenue | % Change |
|---|---:|---:|---:|
| South | \$27,910,000 | \$15,640,000 | **−43.96%** |
| East  | \$34,660,000 | \$9,890,000  | **−71.47%** |
| West  | \$10,030,000 | \$25,830,000 | **+157.53%** |
| North | \$34,280,000 | \$23,930,000 | **−30.19%** |

**Highlights**
- **East** is the acute drop (**−71%**, ≈ **\$24.7M** loss).
- **West** grew strongly (**+157%**), implying regional differences in supply, price, or demand.
- **South** and **North** declined more moderately.

## Working hypotheses (to validate)
- **Supply/Inventory:** stockouts or late deliveries in East.
- **Pricing/Promotions:** promo cadence changed; competitor undercut.
- **Marketing:** reduced spend/targeting in East.
- **CX/Quality:** spikes in returns or complaints.

## 7-day action plan
- **Day 1–2 (Supply Chain):** Audit on-hand, backorders, and lead times (by region/SKU).  
- **Day 2 (Marketing):** Compare May vs June campaign spend, targeting, and creatives (East only).  
- **Day 3 (Pricing):** Review price/bundle changes vs. competitors; propose corrective promo for East.  
- **Day 3–4 (CS):** Pull returns/complaints for June; categorize themes.  
- **Day 5:** Synthesize findings; deploy quick win (promo or allocation shift) and schedule full retro.

## KPIs to monitor
Stock availability %, promo lift %, conversion rate, complaint rate, return rate, and time-to-fulfil.
