## ðŸ§¾ Project Overview

This project builds a **Power BI Dashboard** that tracks real-time inventory and supply chain metrics.  
It integrates data from multiple sources to provide clear visibility into stock levels, restocking trends, and supplier delivery performance.

## ðŸ§  Business Objectives

- Identify **products below reorder level**
- Track **inbound vs outbound movement** of inventory
- Monitor **supplier lead time** and **on-time delivery rates**
- Surface **inventory turnover** and **stock value** trends
- Flag **items not restocked in 30+ days**

---

## ðŸ§° Data Sources

- `Inventory_Levels`: Stock quantities, reorder thresholds, last restock dates  
- `Products`: Product name, category, unit cost, supplier info  
- `Suppliers`: Delivery performance, lead time in days  
- `Inventory_Transactions`: Inbound/Outbound stock movement

- `TotalOutbound`  
- `TotalStockValue`  
- `ReorderCount`  
- `AverageLeadTime`  
- `TurnoverRate`  
- `DaysSinceRestock`  
- `BelowReorder` (calculated column)

## ðŸ“ˆ Visuals & KPIs

- **Cards**: Total Stock Value, Reorder Count, Avg Lead Time  
- **Table**: Products Below Reorder  
- **Bar Chart**: Inventory Value by Product Category  
- **Matrix**: Supplier On-Time Performance
