# SQL Data Analysis: Customer Orders & Inventory

*From raw rows to insight — a clear arc from question to answer.*

## Problem
Use SQL to merge orders with inventory for operational visibility.

## Data
Normalized tables: Customers, Orders, OrderItems, Inventory, Products.

## Approach
Performed SELECTs, JOINs, GROUP BY with aggregations; built views for inventory movement and order fill-rates.

## Key Insights
- Stockouts and slow-movers identified
- Order fulfilment trends measured
- Repeat-customer behaviour explored

## Tools
SQL Server (T-SQL, Views, Aggregations)

## Skills Demonstrated
Schema understanding, query optimisation, reporting SQL

## Repository Contents
- `data/` — sample or anonymised dataset(s)
- `workbooks/` / `sql/` / `notebooks/` — core project files
- `outputs/screenshots/` — static visuals for quick preview

Place `.sql` scripts in `sql/` and add `sample_outputs/` with query result CSVs.
